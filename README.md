# The-OASIS-Project
The OASIS Project, from Ready Player One.

# How to download and play?
Yes, about that...  The game is not available yet...  HOWEVER... I am working hard on it,
and will give you instructions on how to run the game.
(Assuming I work really fast, I might get a release in mid to late March.)

# Will you give a pre-compiled version for us lazy people?
Not at the moment...  Windows defender, being terrible, flags The OASIS Project, (and many other PyInstaller EXE's)
as being a Trojan Horse (Which it is not)

# Why?
I don't know... Ask Microsoft.
